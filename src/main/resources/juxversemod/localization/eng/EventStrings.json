    "DESCRIPTIONS": [
      "The golden light of a sunrise fills an empty library. Ominous, for a place without access to the outside, but hardly the oddest thing the Spire has to offer. NL On a small desk, tucked away in a corner, rests a nondescript black book. It feels like it whispers to you. \n\n~Reading~ ~me~ ~will~ ~grant~ ~you~ ~knowledge~ ~of~ ~abilities~ ~far~ ~beyond~ ~your~ ~own~ ~capabilities.~ \n\nYou feel compelled to read it, but you can try to resist.",
      "The pages fill with tales and tales of full, complete, and unending truths. Looking away takes effort. Leaving the book behind is impossible.\n\n~If~ ~you~ ~follow~ ~this~ ~route~ , ~you~ ~will~ ~reach~ ~the~ ~top~",
      "To leave the book behind is a painful testament of will, and yet you manage to do so. Every book that's talked to you so far has had an agenda. This one is no different."
