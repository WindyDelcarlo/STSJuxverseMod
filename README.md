# Juxverse Mod

The way a story passes from person to person dictates how that story lives and grows. Characters can claim life from being present in the thoughts and minds of the people that know of them.

As the aurora shines over the brilliant night sky, stories told only to a select few are brought before a wider audience. I welcome you to characters and concepts from a setting that friends and I lovingly call Juxtaposition.
