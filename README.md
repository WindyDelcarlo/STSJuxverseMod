# Juxverse Mod

The way a story passes from person to person dictates how that story lives and grows. Characters can claim life from being present in the thoughts and minds of the people that know of them.

As the aurora shines over the brilliant night sky, stories told only to a select few are brought before a wider audience. I welcome you to characters and concepts from a setting that friends and I lovingly call Juxtaposition.

## Contents

- "The Astrologist", a character with a focus on bringing as many stars into being as possible, using huge spells and pushing herself to her limit to do so.
- 10 character-specific relics for The Astrologist
- 5 general-purpose relics that exist in the normal relic pools.
- 1 event-specific relic that shows up in The City and The Beyond.

## Credits

- Mod created by WindyDelcarlo, with assistance from the STS Discord's modding channel.
- (Currently, the art and code was done by me, but that may not necessarily stay the case if other characters are involved)

## Changelog

v. 1.0.0. -- 2025-09-21
- Released with The Astrologist and 16 relics.

v1.0.1 --
- Astrologist renamed to Starseeker, because Astrologist is too common a word.
- Starseeker deck reduced to 10 cards by removing 2 defends (because both her special cards defend anyhow). Turns out most people have 10 cards and not 12. (thanks Silent.)
- Ray of Frost no longer claims that it stops exhausting itself when you upgrade it.
- Astral Form now triggers after you draw, so your temporary Stars have fallen off before Astral Form counts them.
- Starlight Armor+ no longer gives you double your stars to block. Instead, it gives 3+Stars to block. 
- Counterspell now gives Artifact instead of clearing one stack of debuffs. (It makes it harder to get insane numbers of Stars)
- Core Repair now clears a stack of debuffs rather than giving Artifact. 

v1.0.2 --
- Counterspell and Core Repair's text boxes now reflect the change from 1.0.1.
- Overstimulation now says that it's innate when you upgrade it, like it was supposed to the first time.
